## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pseudo class
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt more about to use flex display and different properties associated with it; such as flex-direction

```css
main {
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue focus on been very comfortable with CSS and master its paradigm.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for flex property. I will always use w3 schools, it's always helpful
